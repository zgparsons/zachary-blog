## From Letter 5

>"Philosophy calls for simple living, not for doing penance, and the simple way of life need not be a crude one."

And today's "small find" is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecato_of_Rhodes" target="_blank">Hecato â†—</a>, who Seneca quotes in this letter:


>"Limiting one's desires actually helps to cure one of fear. 'Cease to hope,' he says, 'and you will cease to fear.'"
>
>"Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us, instead of adapting ourslves to the present. [...] A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. No one confines his unhappiness to the present.
