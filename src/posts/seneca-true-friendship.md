## From Letter 3

>"You should discuss everything with a friend; but before you do so, discuss in your mind the man himself. After friendship is formed you must trust, but before that you must judge."


>"People who never relax, and people who are invariably in a relaxed state merit your disapproval."
>
>"A balanced combination of the two attitudes is what we want; the active man should be able to take things easily, while the man who is inclined towards repose should be capable of action. Ask nature: she will tell you that she made both day and night."
